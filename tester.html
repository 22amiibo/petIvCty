        I stand in solidarity with the Ivy City community and ANC5D in demanding the immediate closure and removal of National Engineering Products (NEP) at 
1950 Capitol Ave, NE. It’s far past time to address this long-standing environmental injustice. We call on Mayor Muriel Bowser, the DC Council, the DC Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE), the Department of Licensing and Consumer Protection (DLCP), 
Attorney General Brian Schwalb, and all other decision-makers to act swiftly to shut down NEP. For nearly a century, this plant has released toxic industrial emissions that pose a serious threat to the health and safety of Ivy City residents. This facility produces 
industrial-grade sealants for military and other contracts, utilizing chemicals like Cresol, which fills the air with a harsh tar-like odor. It also uses Methylene Chloride and Formaldehyde—both known carcinogens—along with Acetonitrile, which damages the central nervous 
system, and Toluene, a highly flammable chemical that increases fire and explosion risks. Community-wide testing has revealed alarmingly high levels of these hazardous substances. Shockingly, NEP has operated with little to no oversight. The plant lacks an Air Quality 
permit and has only had a Certificate of Occupancy dating back to 1971. Despite being aware of the facility's noncompliance, DC’s Department of Energy and Environment has failed to take meaningful action to shut it down. But compliance isn’t enough—we are demanding the 
full closure and removal of this facility from Ivy City. There is absolutely no excuse for allowing a plant that uses such dangerous chemicals to operate in the middle of a residential area. The laws and standards have changed to protect communities, yet NEP continues to 
operate as though it’s exempt from accountability. This facility doesn’t belong in Ivy City or any other neighborhood.We urge decision-makers to take immediate and decisive action. It’s time to permanently shut down National Engineering Products and remove it from Ivy 
City—for good. This community deserves better.        </textarea><br><br>
